# notes-api-drf-tutorial


Just a quick little project I made while practicing Django and backend development.  
This is part of my journey as I learn and improve my skills.

## About the Project

This project is built using Django and includes basic frontend styling with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and some JavaScript.  
I usually focus on the backend side of things and try to keep things simple and clean.  
Each project I make is a way for me to learn something new or reinforce what I already know.

## Features

- Note model with `title` and `body` fields
- Full CRUD functionality for authenticated users (read-only for anonymous users)
- Search functionality on note titles using `SearchFilter`
- API documentation available via Swagger UI (`drf-yasg`)
- Basic test coverage for permission control and search functionality

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Django
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
